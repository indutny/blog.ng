<p>About one year ago, I&#39;ve discovered a way to do a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack
on a local Node.js instance. The process involved sending huge amounts of data
to the HTTP server running on the same machine as the attacker, and measuring
the timing differences between various payloads. Given that the scope of attack
was limited to the same machine, it was decided by V8 team and myself that the
issue wasn&#39;t worth looking in yet. Nevertheless, a <a href="https://darksi.de/f.v8-hash-seed-timing-attack/">blog post</a> was published.</p>
<p>This year, I had a chance to revisit the Hash Seed guessing game with restored
enthusiasm and new ideas. The results of this experiment are murky, and no fix
is available yet in V8. Thus <strong>all V8 release lines are vulnerable to the
HashWick attack</strong>.</p>
<p><em>(Disclaimer: the issue was disclosed responsibly. This blog post is published
after more than 90 days since the initial report)</em></p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-hash-seed-">What is a Hash Seed?</h2>
<p>The Hash Seed is a random number that is used as an initial value for the
(non-cryptographic) hash functions inside of V8 instances. Such numbers are used
not only in V8 or other VMs, they&#39;re used in <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/711167/">kernels</a>, <a href="https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/cefe21d28a75f4fdbf24823ce42e777c2b9d5c6f/src/dict.c#L74">databases</a>, and
many different kinds of software.</p>
<p>The reason to have seeded hash functions is to prevent collision attacks on
hash maps (e.g. JavaScript objects/dictionaries). In ideal scenario, use of
random seed should make guessing the hash value of a string/number an impossible
endeavor.</p>
<p>Whenever a Node.js instance parses HTTP headers or JSON object, V8 has to create
a hash map for it. Each hash map is backed by a list (storage) of length
<code>2 * N</code>. The keys are inserted at even positions, the values are inserted at odd
(right after the key). The position index is determined by the hash of the key
modulo the storage size. Two equal keys will have two equal hashes, and will
point to the same cell in the list.</p>
<p>In ideal scenario the indices for two different keys are always different. It
is easy to see that it isn&#39;t possible due to the limited list size. The more
key/value pairs we insert into the object, the more likely the &quot;collision&quot; to
happen. When the hash values are the same, but the keys are different, V8
has to place the key in the next cell... or in the cell after the next, if the
next is filled already.</p>
<p>All in all, this provides quite optimal insertion/lookup performance at
relatively low memory costs.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-attacker-knows-hash-seed-">What if attacker knows Hash Seed?</h2>
<p>Every publicly exposed system is subject for external attacks. In the worst
case, an attacker gains access to the system or data in it. In less worse cases
the attacker might be able to overload the resources of the system by repeatedly
hitting the &quot;slow&quot; paths in the system&#39;s code. Such attacks are called &quot;Denial
of Service&quot; attacks or simply DoS.</p>
<p>For the hash maps in V8, the hash collisions are exactly the slow path. Being
able to generate a lot of (or precompute) keys with similar hash values (for
various hash map storage capacities) without using many resources is a guarantee
of success for such an attack. The worst case scenario is that a small JSON
object (or HTTP headers) could take seconds to parse. Sending thousands of such
objects would render any server unresponsive.</p>
<p>What stands in a way of generating the collisions is a random Hash Seed number.
Given sufficient size of that number and a strong hash function, the indices of
the different keys would look absolutely random. Guessing the Hash Seed becomes
impractical both time-wise and information-wise.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for V8, the hash function isn&#39;t strong enough and the hash seed
is a small number.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-find-v8-s-hash-seed-">How to find V8&#39;s Hash Seed?</h2>
<p>Imagine the following scenario: a Node.js HTTP server is available publicly and
accepts JSON bodies for POST requests. It&#39;d be reasonable to say that many
public Node.js servers are of this kind. It&#39;s important to note that this is
also applicable if Node.js is not directly exposed to a public internet port,
such as the case of being proxy-passed via Nginx.</p>
<p>How can an attacker find the value of V8&#39;s Hash Seed in such case?</p>
<p>This was a subject of my research this and last year. Assuming absence of access
to the server itself, the only way seems to be through the timing differences
between processing different crafted HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Hitting the slow path in hash map key insertion that we discussed above should
give a slightly slower response time. Knowing a lot of key combinations that
cause the slowdown (and as many combinations that doesn&#39;t cause one) is enough
for reconstructing the seed value. The problem is, the difference between slow
and fast path is in the order of microseconds, while the network latency is
often at least a couple of milliseconds. The network jitter overwrites any minor
timing differences without leaving us a chance to measure them.</p>
<p>What is needed for successful attack is an <strong>&quot;amplification&quot;</strong>. The request has
to be crafted in such way that the key insertion is triggered many times in a
sequence for the same key and same hash map contents. Each insertion would take
just a couple of microseconds, but a thousand of them would add up to a
millisecond!</p>
<p>Without giving away the complete tools for crafting such an attack, I can say
that the JSON body might look like this:</p>
<p><code>{&quot;100000&quot;:0,&quot;101&quot;:1,&quot;101&quot;:1,...repeat many times...}</code></p>
<p>It exploits several implementation details in V8 and a few quirks of JavaScript.
In particular, a JavaScript number lookup <code>obj[100000]</code> is equivalent to
looking up the &quot;stringified&quot; value of the same number <code>obj[&quot;100000&quot;]</code>.</p>
<p>The next quirk is that JSON objects might contain duplicate keys. Each key will
be parsed and looked up in the object, regardless of how many times it is
repeated in the JSON. <em>Each lookup triggers either slow or fast path in the
insertion code</em>.</p>
<p>The object above essentially becomes a sparse <code>Array</code> backed by a hash map with
very shallow storage capacity (just <code>4</code> values). Here&#39;s how V8 inserts key into
it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initially <code>storage</code> is <code>[ null, null, null, null ]</code></li>
<li>The index of the first key (<code>100000</code>) is computed using the hash function and
the hash seed: <code>index = hash(100000, seed) % 4</code></li>
<li>The value <code>0</code> is inserted into that slot of storage (e.g. <code>index = 1</code>):
<code>[ null, 0, null, null ]</code></li>
<li>The index of the second key is computed
<code>index_2 = hash(random_key, seed) % 4</code></li>
<li><code>while (storage[index_2] != null) index_2++</code></li>
<li>The value is stored in <code>index_2</code> slot</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 5 is crucial for my attack. The extra check takes extra time, and this time
difference could be measured to get information about the hash seed.</p>
<p>Thus fixing the first key to <code>100000</code>, and trying out different keys
(probes) will give us the list of timings per each random key. Quarter of the
probes will have the same index as <code>100000</code> and will hit the slow path due to
collision. The rest will go through the fast path. The processing script would
later go through the list of timings and separate it by <code>75%</code> percentile of
latency. Most probes would be correctly classified as fast/slow. Misclassified
probes would increase Hash Seed search time.</p>
<p>The result of processing is a list of probe keys, each with an assigned class:
&quot;same index as 100000&quot; or &quot;different index&quot;. Each entry of this list is a
constraint on the Hash Seed value. An OpenCL script goes through all possible
32-bit Hash Seed values (<code>0 - 0x3fffffff</code>), and finds the one that satisfies
the majority of the constraints. That value is the most likely Hash Seed of the
attacked V8 instance. The OpenCL computation could take place on either CPU or
GPU, and completes the search in about one minute on my MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>My unoptimized PoC sends about 2 gb of JSON data to the server, collects the
timing information, and computes the Hash Seed in a <em>couple of minutes</em> (this
includes OpenCL brute-force time).</p>
<h2 id="prevention">Prevention</h2>
<p>This sounds dreary, but the fixes can be made. First of all, the hash seed size
has to be increased from 32 bits to 64 bits (this is already done in V8). Next,
the hash function has to be changed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash">SipHash</a> or other hash function with
PRF (Pseudo-Random Function) properties.</p>
<p>Google has an amazing team working on V8. I&#39;m really hopeful that the remaining
fixes will be completed soon.</p>
<h2 id="prior-art">Prior-Art</h2>
<p>The hash collision attacks have <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/474912/">a long history</a>, and most of the software
projects has moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash">SipHash</a> and at least 64-bit Hash Seed since then.</p>
