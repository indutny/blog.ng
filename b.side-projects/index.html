        <section class=post-body>
          <p>After reading <a href="https://github.com/antirez">antirez</a>&#39;s <a href="http://antirez.com/news/86">blog post</a> I decided that it might be a good
exercise to write down the notable side projects that I spent my time upon since
Jan 2014.</p>
<p>Here is the list and some comments from me:</p>
<h3 id="bn-js"><a href="https://github.com/indutny/bn.js">bn.js</a></h3>
<p>JavaScript library for working with Big Numbers. <a href="https://github.com/indutny/bn.js">bn.js</a> is an ultra-fast
<a href="https://github.com/justmoon/node-bignum">bignum</a> alternative with support for running in io.js/node.js and browsers.</p>
<p>This one took lots of time and effort through whole year with some periodic
<a href="https://github.com/indutny/bn.js/graphs/contributors">sparks in a contributions graph</a>, and many PRs from OpenSource community.
Seriously, big kudos to you people for helping me with it!</p>
<h3 id="elliptic"><a href="https://github.com/indutny/elliptic">elliptic</a></h3>
<p>JS library for doing Elliptic Curve crypto. It was the reason for creating the
<a href="https://github.com/indutny/bn.js">bn.js</a> in the first place, and excuse for me to learn more about EC
cryptography and crazy math behind it.</p>
<h3 id="bud"><a href="https://github.com/indutny/bud">bud</a></h3>
<p>A friendly and clever TLS-terminating proxy in C.</p>
<p>Although I worked on it since Nov 2013, lots of development happened during the
2014 year. This is my biggest project in C so far, and it has taught me a lot
about designing the APIs and interfaces in low-level languages.</p>
<p>Bud seens lots of love from <a href="https://github.com/odeke-em">Emmanuel Odeke</a>. Big thanks to you, Emmanuel!</p>
<h3 id="tls-js"><a href="https://github.com/indutny/tls.js">tls.js</a></h3>
<p>(Incomplete) TLS implementation in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Totally experimental protocol implementation. Did it just for fun, but it turned
to be useful in screening the web servers.</p>
<h3 id="hash-js"><a href="https://github.com/indutny/hash.js">hash.js</a></h3>
<p>Implementations of SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, RIPEMD160, various
HMACs. One of the mandatory dependencies of...</p>
<h3 id="bcoin"><a href="https://github.com/indutny/bcoin">bcoin</a></h3>
<p>BitCoin SPV client implementation. Purely experimental, but I heard that some
people do use it.</p>
<p>Lots of contributions from <a href="https://github.com/chjj">Christopher Jeffrey</a> here. Thank you!</p>
<h3 id="bthread-src-"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bthread/ldbfhhncehnfgppdlgjhfgffachpehkd">bthread</a> (<a href="https://github.com/indutny/bthread">src</a>)</h3>
<p>Writing blog posts in a BitCoin block-chain.</p>
<p><em>I know many people hate me for this, but still I wanted to experiment with it
a little</em>.</p>
<h3 id="js-js"><a href="https://github.com/js-js/js.js">js.js</a></h3>
<p>JS JIT compiler written in JS.</p>
<p>Very preliminary implementation with little or no compatibility with ECMAScript
yet :)</p>
<h3 id="heap-js-jit-js-cfg-js-"><a href="https://github.com/js-js">heap.js, jit.js, cfg.js, ...</a></h3>
<p>Various <a href="https://github.com/js-js/js.js">js.js</a> dependencies.</p>
<h3 id="lll-reduction"><a href="https://github.com/indutny/lll-reduction">lll-reduction</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenstra%E2%80%93Lenstra%E2%80%93Lov%C3%A1sz_lattice_basis_reduction_algorithm">Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász algorithm</a> JavaScript implementation.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t remember exact reasons for writing this, but I guess I thought about
doing more optimal <a href="http://www.hyperelliptic.org/tanja/conf/ECC08/slides/Mike-Scott.pdf">GLV Method</a> for <a href="https://github.com/indutny/elliptic">elliptic</a>.</p>
<h3 id="core2dump"><a href="https://github.com/indutny/core2dump">core2dump</a></h3>
<p>Creating heap snapshots out of the core file on OS X, linuxes, and FreeBSD.</p>
<h3 id="asn1-js"><a href="https://github.com/indutny/asn1.js">asn1.js</a></h3>
<p>ASN.1 encoding implementation in JS.</p>
<h3 id="miller-rabin"><a href="https://github.com/indutny/miller-rabin">miller-rabin</a></h3>
<p>Miller-Rabin primality test in JS.</p>
<h3 id="caine"><a href="https://github.com/indutny/caine">caine</a></h3>
<p>Butler bot for github projects. I wanted it to be used for io.js, but we decided
to walk a different road.</p>
<h4 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h4>
<p>I guess that&#39;s it.</p>
<p>Most of these projects were a big incentive for me to dig into the protocols,
technology, science. I find it much more enjoyable and interesting to
investigate new topics through their applications.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for all your contributions, people! It is really awesome to see
you interested in helping me with these and other projects!</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for reading this.</p>
